# Video Corruption Fixer

This Python script serves as a tool for attempting to address issues related to corrupt video files. By leveraging the `imageio_ffmpeg`, `opencv-python`, and `numpy` libraries, it aims to read corrupted video files and create a new, potentially recovered video file. While not a guaranteed solution, the script may be helpful in salvaging as much content as possible from damaged videos.

## Usage

1. Install the required libraries using `pip install imageio[ffmpeg] opencv-python numpy`.
2. Replace 'corrupted_input.mp4' with the path to your corrupted video file.
3. Specify the desired output file name, for example, 'fixed_output.avi'.
4. Run the script.

## Features

- Utilizes the `imageio_ffmpeg` library for reading video files of various formats.
- Extracts video properties (frame rate, width, height) from the corrupted video.
- Creates a new video file using OpenCV (`cv2.VideoWriter`) with the 'XVID' codec.
- Attempts to recover frames from the corrupted video and write them to the new output video file.

## Important Notes

- The success of video recovery depends on the type and extent of corruption; severely damaged videos may not be fully recoverable.
- Ensure the required libraries are installed and adjust file paths as needed.
- Seek professional assistance for critical data recovery needs.

## Disclaimer

This script is a basic attempt to address video corruption and may not work in all cases. It is not a substitute for specialized tools or professional services.
