## Description

The Video Recovery Tool is a Python script designed to assist in recovering and fixing corrupted video files. Leveraging the power of the `imageio` and `opencv` libraries, this tool attempts to salvage as much content as possible from damaged video files. While the success of recovery is dependent on the nature and extent of corruption, the tool provides a convenient starting point for users dealing with video-related issues.

## Features

- **Cross-Format Support:** Compatible with a variety of video formats, allowing users to recover corrupted videos with different extensions.

- **Automated Recovery:** The tool automates the recovery process by reading corrupted videos and creating a new video file, minimizing manual intervention.

- **User-Friendly:** Designed with simplicity in mind, enabling users to fix corrupted videos with just a few steps.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Dependencies: `imageio`, `opencv-python`

Install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Replace 'corrupted_input.mp4' and 'fixed_output.mp4' with your actual file names. Run the script using:

```bash
python recovery_script.py
```

## Important Notes

- Video corruption recovery is not always guaranteed, and success depends on the type and extent of corruption.
- For severe cases, consider professional video recovery services.
